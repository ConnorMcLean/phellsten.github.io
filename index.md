 
#    Week 2 Blog Post - Road To Nowhere
 
The aim of our project is to explore and attempt to help with the issues of public transport in Melbourne.

Nearly every day commuters are faced with delays, late buses and trains, or being plagued by ticket inspectors. This issue is a huge challenge to solve, so our solution will attempt to assist commuters in their daily struggles.

According to the Herald Sun, "Customers made 282 complaints against authorized officers this financial year."

When we use public transport in Melbourne, we may often be stressed by running late. Add being hassled and intimidated by ticket inspectors on top of this and for some it may be too much.

Road To Nowhere will uncover the true problems within Melbourne's public transport system and provide a useful web application to help travellers.
