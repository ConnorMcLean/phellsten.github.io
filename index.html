From the project spec:  You are allowed to do some off-line data processing (outside IVLE) to speed up your data analysis				
	Might we do the processsing to create a JSON file for every chart offline?			
				
	1. Lock in the questions we want to ask			
	2. For each Q, figure out what processing needs to be done (create it's own csv file?)			
				*just some of the options we tossed around on FB
		1. How many developers have there been over time? Which are the oldest? How many games were they publishing?		1.looked at original .xlsx, we can find out whether the scores are satisfied with a normal distribution, which means it's fair. 
			1.2. For each year (header), lookup unique developers (and count how times they published something)	2.find out which types of games has highest scores
			^^ not including when one game is published across multiple platforms?	3.which console / PC/ mobile device has better rated games 
		2. How diverse has each publisher been? i.e. How many genres have they explored?		4. Can you find these games' year? If so, we can find the trend of scores respects with year
			2.2. For each publisher, lookup unique genres they have published (and how many counts of each genre)	5. Predecessor's rates' effect on games' rate. In other words, good rated games is likely to having good rated successor?
			^^ not including when one game is published across multiple platforms?	6. We might find score distribution of a publisher over time to see if publishers learn over time.
		3. What trends can we see in publisher game scores? Do publishers learn from their experiences? (or do scores reflect the evolving expectations, making this question NULL??)		7. Find score by year, to see if 2014 really was the worst year gaming has ever seen.
			3.2. *not sure what data format we'd need right now* perhaps, for each year who has published something; if they published something, what was it's score? map the trend over time?	8. Find score distribution of all games to see what an "average" game really is
		*Q1-3 could be grouped as publisher questions		
				
		4. What platforms are the developers most comfortable with? i.e. For games released on multiple platforms, does any platform tend to run better?		
		(may have to group based on xbox360, ps3, PC | mobile vs other platforms)		
			4.2. We could probably do a few visualisations from this: Xbox 360 vs PS4 vs PC, or Mobile vs Other (casual vs high investment)	
			       lookup games with multiple instances in the data, store platform + score	
				
		5. Which platforms are the most active? i.e. How many games have been published and reviewed each year?		
			5.2 lookup year, +1 to relevant platfom per instance	
		*Q4-5 could be grouped as platform questions		
				
				
	3. Draw out what we expect the visualisation should look like			
	4. Get coding!
