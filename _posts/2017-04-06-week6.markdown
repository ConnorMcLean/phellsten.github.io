# Dynamic Webpage

For this week we were required to demonstrate improve upon our basic Static webpage we showed Last week and make it dynamic. This is our page from last week if you remember.

# Old:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Week5/Screenshot.PNG" alt="Image Test">

And this is our home page as of today;

# New:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Week6/NewHome6.jpg" alt="Image Test">

INSERT LINK TO NEW SITE

TO obtain the data for our issue and map pages, we utilised data from the PTV API through JSON. THen using JavaScript we iterativcely placed all the data in their respective tables, resulting in the content on their respective pages.

Maps CAMERON I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU DID PLS HALP MapAPI thins?

We used a a global styles.css which is present in all our webpages, before becoming more speciofic with them. Utilising these page specific CSS files to manipulate backgrounds and changing Page specific items, such as the padding and assorted colours.


For future improvement of out webpage, we intend to improve the map functionality and the User submitted delay experience to be slightly more specific.
