# Dynamic Webpage

For this week we were required to demonstrate improve upon our basic Static webpage we showed Last week and make it dynamic. This is our page from last week if you remember with a couple of improvements.

# Home:

All the pages referenced in the navigation bar are linked to their respective pages, along with the report a delay button on the home page which takes you to a seperate form to fill out, which would allow end users to contribute data to the page in some way.

# JSON

TO obtain the data for our issue and map pages, we utilised data from the PTV API through JSON. Then through usage of Javascript the data is iteratievely added to their respective categories within the pages. Such as shown below;

# Maps

The interactive maps were implemented using the Javascript library Leaflet for creating and designing the map visualisations. The underlying tile map design being used is provided by the MapBox API, with the map vector data courtesy of OpenStreetMap.

Overlaying the base map layer is a vector line visualisation of the routes for Victoria's Tram, Train, Metro Bus, and Regional Bus routes, with each transportation type given its own filterable layer. The spatial data used for this was downloaded from the Victorian Government Data Directory, as Shape files. This required converting these files to the GeoJSON format for it to be usable by Leaflet, in addition to changing the geographic coordinate system of the coordinate data. 

This spatial data is also used by our JavaScript functions to populate the collapsible list of transport routes adjacent to the interactive map, that will, hopefully, be used later to allow users to actively filter transport routes on the interactive map.



We used a a global styles.css which is present in all our webpages, before becoming more specific with them. Utilising these page specific CSS files to manipulate backgrounds and changing Page specific items, such as the padding and assorted colours.

For future improvement of our webpage, we intend to improve the map functionality and the User submitted delay experience to be slightly more specific, and to have additional pages viewable by the user upon logging in, where they can subscribe to certain train/bus lines.

We also aim to further improve the Issues page, in which users can filter and search through lines, additionally we plan to integrate the user reporting data into this list.
