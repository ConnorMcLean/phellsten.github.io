# Dynamic Webpage

For this week we were required to demonstrate improve upon our basic Static webpage we showed Last week and make it dynamic. This is our page from last week if you remember with a couple of improvements.

# Home:

All the pages referenced in the navigation bar are linked to their respective pages, along with the report a delay button on the home page which takes you to a seperate form to fill out, which would allow end users to contribute data to the page in some way.

Link to New site: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}website/index.html">Road to Nowhere Interactive Webpages</a>

# JSON

TO obtain the data for our issue and map pages, we utilised data from the PTV API through JSON. Then through usage of javascript the data is iteratievely added to their respective categories within the pages. Such as shown below;

We used a a global styles.css which is present in all our webpages, before becoming more speciofic with them. Utilising these page specific CSS files to manipulate backgrounds and changing Page specific items, such as the padding and assorted colours.

For future improvement of out webpage, we intend to improve the map functionality and the User submitted delay experience to be slightly more specific.
