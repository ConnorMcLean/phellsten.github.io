This week we had to create a static webpage for our transport site. We have created several static pages including the Home, About, Interactive Map, Login and Sign Up pages. We also have a few other tentative powerpoint mockups of additional pages the site contains.

As shown in the mock-up from last week, our static home page contains a navigation bar as well as a notification system for the major delays on certain lines, however there is only a couple of notifications at the current moment as placeholders. We decided to stay with  our original font choice as it helps convey the convenience and inevitable calmness of knowing whats going on around you relative to transport issues.

The page is pretty self-explanatory in its expected implementation, with Home redirecting to the current page, being mainly for usage on seperate pages. The about button will link the user to a page in which we are intending to have communicate to potential users the benefits of using our system over the standard ptv counterparts. Login and signup take you to seperate login/register screens depending upon user selection. Post having loggged in a page with bookmarked routes would be displayed indicating all delays relative to the user.

The continue button would link to another page where users can report various things such as delays and warnings to be displayed to other users of the site.

# MORE COMMENTS ON MOCKUPS

We have a couple mockups above for other possible pages our site may contain, however these are still a work in progress and are in no way final.
