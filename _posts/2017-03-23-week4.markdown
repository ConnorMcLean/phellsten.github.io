Mood Board

We aim to envoke feelings of confidence, success and happiness in our design, to help commuters feel that they don't have to worry about getting to their destination on time, and that they can relax.

To fit this mood we chose a bright and colourful colour-scheme and picked images and fonts that felt light-hearted and uplifting.

Wireframe

In building our wireframe, we wanted to make it easy for users to access some important information at a glance, but also not to clutter the main page with too much detail.

Mockup

We chose a background for our mockup that fit the theme of public transport, and also matched our colour palette. The red title is eye-catching and draws the readers attention.
