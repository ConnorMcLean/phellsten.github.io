Mood Board

Through our Moodboard, we aim to envoke feelings of confidence, success and happiness in our design, to help commuters feel that they don't have to worry about getting to their destination on time. That if there was an issue, they would know straight away, allowing them to plan their respective days around it, giving them the confidence as they go about their days.

To fit this mood we chose a bright and colourful colour-scheme and picked images and fonts that felt light-hearted and uplifting.

Colour Scheme

After experimenting with multiple darker colour chemes, we came to the conclusion we required a happier more uplifting tone,  one which didn't leave the user with a lingering sense of concern, post having possibly been notified about large delays. 
The basis for our colour choice stemmed from what people first think of when you mention public transport in Melbourne. Hence the choice of yellow and blue.

Fonts

To fit our brighter, uplifting colour-scheme, we needed the fonts to match. We went for the fonts below as they communicated the light-hearted vibe we were aiming for, while still beaing quite legible and not as childish as other fonts we looked at.

Wireframe

In building our wireframe, we wanted to make it easy for users to access some important information at a glance, but also not to clutter the main page with too much detail.

Mockup

We chose a background for our mockup that fit the theme of public transport, and also matched our colour palette. The red title is eye-catching and draws the readers attention. All that was required was a darkening of the image to allow for higher contrast between the text and the background, increasing legibility.
